# Ruby Final Project: Chess
The title says it; the concluding project in the Ruby course. Excited yet intimidated. This is a testament to the ending of my Ruby journey. It's been long since I walked down this path, and Ruby on Rails is within my reach.

Chess is a classical board game that is played since the ancient times until now. This is composed of a 8x8 dimension board, with 16 pieces each from both players.

I have quite some experience with Chess as I used to play consistently at chess.com. This will be a tiny  advantage on my part, but nonetheless this will be a challenging project.  

## Features
1. The game will be played via command line. Ruby 3.2.2 must be installed.
2. To make a move, the player must enter the origin and destination coordinates e.g. "e2e4"
3. The game consists of a save and load feature.
4. Players can choose to resign or ask for a draw.
