Step by step plan which features to create in order:
  1. Create the board
  2. Assemble the pieces in the created board
  3. Give the pieces ability to move
    - King
    - Queen
    - Rooks
    - Bishops
    - Knights
    - Pawns
  4. Make an array of possible moves by black/white for a king's checklist of checks, 
     thus preventing the king from moving on those squares
  5. Add resign, draw, or save options

Game flow in CLI:
  1. Prints the board with 8-1 at left side and A-H at bottom side.
  2. Displays the current player
  3. Provide instructions:
    - To move, type the current coordinate to desired coordinate with hyphen e.g. "e2-e4"
    - To save, type "save"
    - To load the previous saved file, type "load"
    - To resign, type "resign" and the current player loses, display the next player as winner
    - To ask for draw, type "draw?", display a message for the next player to type "accept" or "decline"
    - To castle short side, type "O-O", and for long side, "O-O-O"
  4. If a player wins, display the winner message and end the game.
